# Slide Item

Slide Item is a custom control that uses three buttons to emulate a list item that can accept slide left, slide left, or tap/click gestures.  These actions fire events that registered handlers can use to run actions associated with the list item.  For instance, slide left can toggle task completion status, slide right can initiate a deletion, and click can initiate editing.

It's crude, and it probably doesn't work nearly as well as it should, but it emulates the functionality enough with Windows Forms to be somewhat passable.
