# Exercise 1 - Event Handlers

Exercise 1 - Event Handlers, is a simple application that presents the user with two lists, one for courses pending, and one for courses completed.  Users can add a course to the pending list via a dialog, and with any selected course in either list, swap it to another list, edit it, or delete it.  A file menu allows for saving the lists to XML that can be loaded later or saving to a plain text file suitable for printing.
