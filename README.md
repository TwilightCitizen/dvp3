# Development Portfolio 3 (DVP3) - Coding Exercises & Final Project

DVP3 is the third portfolio course in Full Sail University's Mobile Development bachelor degreee track.  Among its requirements, students are expected to to submit full solutions to weekly coding exercises as well as a final software project in the last week, the latter of which is developed throughout the month.  As such, this repository is divided into two primary sections, **Exercises** and **Final Project**.

## Exercises

The Exercises section is comprised of--minimally--3 folders, one for each weekly coding exercise.  More folders may or may not be required, dependent on the introduction of additional coding exercises or the lack there of as the month progresses.  Each folder will have it's own README.md that explicates the nature of the contained exercise.

## Final Project

The Final Project section is comprised of 2 folders thus far.  One folder contains the primary client application to be developed throughout the month, and other contains the companion web API server to be developed in tandem, in lieu of using an established web API.  These folders, too, will have their own README.md explicating the nature of the applications within.

## Library

Library contains any various classes that provide broad functionality across DVP3 projects.  At this juncture, it contains only one: iPhonify class library.
